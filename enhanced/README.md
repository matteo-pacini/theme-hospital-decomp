# Theme Hospital Enhanced

A new engine for Theme Hospital, written in C++20 with SDL3 and Dear ImGui,
for Windows, macOS and Linux. It reads the data of your own copy of the game
and draws it at any resolution and aspect ratio. The decompilation in `../src`
is its reference: behaviour is ported from it function by function.

It contains no game files. At start-up it looks for the game data and, if it
finds none, says what it needs and lets you pick the folder.

## Status

Milestone 1, the map at any resolution:

- the game's data formats: RNC-compressed files (both CRCs checked), the
  palette, the two sprite codings (map blocks and panel/screens) and level
  maps;
- a level's starting map built as the game builds it (public land, your plot,
  grass, decorations and partition walls), drawn isometrically into an 8-bit
  indexed view the size of the window, then scaled by a whole number for
  sharp pixels;
- the bottom panel at native size, centred;
- scrolling (arrow keys or WASD, the window edges, middle or right drag) and
  zoom (mouse wheel; automatic keeps at least 480 lines);
- developer tools (F1): frame time, view size, camera and cell under the
  mouse, level picker, palette and sprite viewer.

Not yet: objects placed by the level, shadows, people, the simulation and the
game's screens.

## Game data

The data folder is the one holding `DATA`, `LEVELS` and `QDATA` (file names
are matched case-insensitively). It is looked for in this order:

1. `--data <folder>` on the command line;
2. the development folder, `../orig` (the repository's `orig/`, where
   `nix run path:./nix#gog-unpack` puts the GOG release). Builds for others
   should turn it off with `-DTH_DEV_DATA_DIR=`;
3. the folder chosen before, saved in the user's preferences folder;
4. next to the program, then the working directory.

If none holds the game, a screen lists where it looked and what was missing,
with a button to choose the folder.

## Building

From the repository root, with Nix:

    nix run path:./nix#enhanced            # build (Release) and run
    nix run path:./nix#enhanced -- --level 5

or by hand (CMake 3.24+, a C++20 compiler; SDL3 is used from the system if
found, otherwise fetched, and Dear ImGui is always fetched):

    nix develop path:./nix#enhanced
    cmake -S enhanced -B build/enhanced -G Ninja
    cmake --build build/enhanced
    build/enhanced/th_enhanced

Tests: `ctest --test-dir build/enhanced`. The tests that need the game data
read it from the development folder and are skipped without it.

Without a window, `--screenshot OUT.bmp --data FOLDER [--level N] [--size WxH]`
renders a level's start view to a BMP.

## Layout

    src/core/data/    file formats: RNC, sprites, palette, levels, the data folder
    src/core/render/  indexed surface, sprite drawing, isometric map, panel
    src/app/          SDL3 window and input, data-folder search, settings, ImGui tools
    tests/            ctest tests
